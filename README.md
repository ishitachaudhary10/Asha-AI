# Asha-AI

Asha AI is an AI-powered web application designed to assess an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on health and lifestyle inputs. The platform focuses on early intervention and preventive healthcare by providing accurate predictions and transparent explanations of results. By combining machine learning with a user-friendly interface, Asha AI aims to make health risk assessments accessible, reliable, and easy to understand.

The system leverages XGBoost and Random Forest models for high-accuracy predictions, with thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure model robustness. To address data imbalance, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used, improving the model’s generalizability. For explainability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is integrated to visualize feature contributions, enhancing user trust in AI-driven medical predictions.

A lightweight Flask backend handles model inference and API requests, while the frontend is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive user experience. The Gemini API is incorporated to offer intelligent, conversational feedback, making complex health insights more approachable for users.

Asha AI was recognized for its innovation and technical depth, securing 1st Runner-Up at Agent’s Fest 2025, a prestigious IEEE national-level hackathon focused on AI applications in healthcare.

Looking ahead, the project envisions expanding its scope to predict other chronic diseases, integrating with electronic health records (EHRs), and adding multilingual support to improve accessibility for diverse user groups.
